Another year of Advent of Code!
This time, in Elixir. I think that means I need to do as much concurrency as possible....

Having spent a lot of time in the linux shell, I'm looking forward to piping output of one function into a new function. Otherwise, I have no idea what to expect.

Happy coding, all!
